                Founded in 2020 by Apon, TripBuzz has come a long way from its beginnings.
                When Apon first started out, his passion for travel drove him to quit his day job,
                and turn hard work and inspiration into a booming online store.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
                We now serve customers all over the world, and are thrilled that we're able to turn
                our passion into our own website.
            </p>
